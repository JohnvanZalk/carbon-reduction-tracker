# carbon-reduction-tracker

Webpage to display utility emission reduction and renewable energy goals.

Utility emission reduction and renewable energy goals will be represented in both a map of utility service territories and a corresponding list of utility goals.

It will be a resource for utilities to compare their goals with others across the country and potentially connect them with one another.

This deliverable will also help corporations coordinate their decarbonization and renewable energy goals by allowing them to identify utilities with similar goals where their operations are located.

Lastly, this will be a resource for government, advocacy, non-profit, and academic groups to conduct research and work towards further carbon reduction.
